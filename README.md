# BoQ classifier into ICMS

## Classification of Construction-related BoQ data into ICMS 

This is sample data and ML/AI models to support the Article *"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Construction Cost Documents into the International Construction Measurement Standard"* by J. I Deza, H. Ihshaish and L. Mahdjoubi. 

Here we feature a collection of algorithms developed and tested in the aforementioned paper and provide an opportunity to test the trained model with natural langauge queries by using the Random Forests Classifier.
